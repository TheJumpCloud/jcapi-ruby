  # Manage the associations of a System Group
  # This endpoint allows you to manage the _direct_ associations of a System Group.

  # unit tests for graph_system_group_traverse_command
  # List the Commands bound to a System Group
  # This endpoint will return all Commands bound to a System Group, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.  Each element will contain the group&#39;s type, id, attributes and paths.  The &#x60;attributes&#x60; object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.  The &#x60;paths&#x60; array enumerates each path from this System Group to the corresponding Command; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the Command from this System Group.  See &#x60;/members&#x60; and &#x60;/associations&#x60; endpoints to manage those collections.  #### Sample Request &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; curl -X GET https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/systemgroups/{GroupID}/commands \\   -H &#39;Accept: application/json&#39; \\   -H &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; \\   -H &#39;x-api-key: {API_KEY}&#39; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
