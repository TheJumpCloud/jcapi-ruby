  # List the associations of a Command
  # This endpoint will return the _direct_ associations of this Command.  A direct association can be a non-homogeneous relationship between 2 different objects, for example Commands and User Groups.   #### Sample Request &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; curl -X GET https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/commands/{Command_ID}/associations?targets&#x3D;system_group \\   -H &#39;accept: application/json&#39; \\   -H &#39;content-type: application/json&#39; \\   -H &#39;x-api-key: {API_KEY}&#39; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

  # Manage the associations of a Command
  # This endpoint will allow you to manage the _direct_ associations of this Command.  A direct association can be a non-homogeneous relationship between 2 different objects, for example Commands and User Groups.   #### Sample Request &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  curl -X POST https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/commands/{Command_ID}/associations \\   -H &#39;accept: application/json&#39; \\   -H &#39;content-type: application/json&#39; \\   -H &#39;x-api-key: {API_KEY}&#39; \\   -d &#39;{     \&quot;op\&quot;: \&quot;add\&quot;,     \&quot;type\&quot;: \&quot;system_group\&quot;,     \&quot;id\&quot;: \&quot;Group_ID\&quot; }&#39; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

  # unit tests for graph_command_traverse_system
  # List the Systems bound to a Command
  # This endpoint will return all Systems bound to a Command, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.  Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.  The &#x60;attributes&#x60; object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.  The &#x60;paths&#x60; array enumerates each path from this Command to the corresponding System; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the System from this Command.  See &#x60;/members&#x60; and &#x60;/associations&#x60; endpoints to manage those collections.  #### Sample Request &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; curl -X GET https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/commands/{Command_ID}/systems \\   -H &#39;accept: application/json&#39; \\   -H &#39;content-type: application/json&#39; \\   -H &#39;x-api-key: {API_KEY}&#39; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
