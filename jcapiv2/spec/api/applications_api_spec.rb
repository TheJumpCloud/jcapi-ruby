  # unit tests for graph_application_traverse_user
  # List the Users bound to an Application
  # This endpoint will return all Users bound to an Application, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.   Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.  The &#x60;attributes&#x60; object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.  The &#x60;paths&#x60; array enumerates each path from this Application to the corresponding User; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the User from this Application.
