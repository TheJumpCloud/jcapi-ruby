  # unit tests for graph_command_traverse_system
  # List the Systems bound to a Command
  # This endpoint will return all Systems bound to a Command, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.  Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.  The &#x60;attributes&#x60; object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.  The &#x60;paths&#x60; array enumerates each path from this Command to the corresponding System; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the System from this Command.
