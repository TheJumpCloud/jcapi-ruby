  # unit tests for graph_application_associations_list
  # List the associations of an Application
  # This endpoint will return the _direct_ associations of an Application. A direct association can be a non-homogeneous relationship between 2 different objects, for example Applications and User Groups.   #### Sample Request &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; curl -X GET &#39;https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/applications/{Application_ID}/associations?targets&#x3D;user_group \\   -H &#39;accept: application/json&#39; \\   -H &#39;content-type: application/json&#39; \\   -H &#39;x-api-key: {API_KEY}&#39; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

  # unit tests for graph_application_associations_post
  # Manage the associations of an Application
  # This endpoint allows you to manage the _direct_ associations of an Application. A direct association can be a non-homogeneous relationship between 2 different objects, for example Application and User Groups.  #### Sample Request &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; curl -X POST &#39;https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/applications/{Application_ID}/associations&#39; \\   -H &#39;accept: application/json&#39; \\   -H &#39;content-type: application/json&#39; \\   -H &#39;x-api-key: {API_KEY}&#39; \\   -d &#39;{     \&quot;op\&quot;: \&quot;add\&quot;,     \&quot;type\&quot;: \&quot;user_group\&quot;,     \&quot;id\&quot;: \&quot;{Group_ID}\&quot; }&#39; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

  # unit tests for graph_application_traverse_user
  # List the Users bound to an Application
  # This endpoint will return all Users bound to an Application, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.   Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.  The &#x60;attributes&#x60; object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.  The &#x60;paths&#x60; array enumerates each path from this Application to the corresponding User; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the User from this Application.  See &#x60;/members&#x60; and &#x60;/associations&#x60; endpoints to manage those collections.  #### Sample Request &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; curl -X GET https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/applications/{Application_ID}/users \\   -H &#39;accept: application/json&#39; \\   -H &#39;content-type: application/json&#39; \\   -H &#39;x-api-key: {API_KEY}&#39; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
