  # This endpoint returns _direct_ associations of an Office 365 instance.   A direct association can be a non-homogeneous relationship between 2 different objects, for example Office 365 and Users.  #### Sample Request &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; curl -X GET &#39;https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/office365s/{O365_ID}/associations?targets&#x3D;user_group \\   -H &#39;Accept: application/json&#39; \\   -H &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; \\   -H &#39;x-api-key: {API_KEY}&#39;  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

  # This endpoint allows you to manage the _direct_ associations of a Office 365 instance.  A direct association can be a non-homogeneous relationship between 2 different objects, for example Office 365 and Users.  #### Sample Request &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; curl -X POST https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/office365s/{O365_ID}/associations \\   -H &#39;Accept: application/json&#39; \\   -H &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; \\   -H &#39;x-api-key: {API_KEY}&#39; \\   -d &#39;{     \&quot;op\&quot;: \&quot;add\&quot;,     \&quot;type\&quot;: \&quot;user_group\&quot;,     \&quot;id\&quot;: \&quot;{Group_ID}\&quot; }&#39; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

  # unit tests for graph_office365_traverse_user
  # List the Users bound to an Office 365 instance
  # This endpoint will return all Users bound to an Office 365 instance, either directly or indirectly, essentially traversing the JumpCloud Graph for your Organization.  Each element will contain the type, id, attributes and paths.  The &#x60;attributes&#x60; object is a key/value hash of compiled graph attributes for all paths followed.  The &#x60;paths&#x60; array enumerates each path from this Office 365 instance to the corresponding User; this array represents all grouping and/or associations that would have to be removed to deprovision the User from this Office 365 instance.  See &#x60;/members&#x60; and &#x60;/associations&#x60; endpoints to manage those collections.  #### Sample Request &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; curl -X GET https://console.jumpcloud.com/api/v2/office365s/{O365_ID}/users \\   -H &#39;Accept: application/json&#39; \\   -H &#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39; \\   -H &#39;x-api-key: {API_KEY}&#39; &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
